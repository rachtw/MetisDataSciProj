    "#### Goal\n",
    "KKBox is an unlimited music streaming service in Asia. It provides over 30 million tracks and has a comprehensive Asia-Pop music library. KKBox currently offers monthly subscription to millions of users. Users can choose to auto-renew their subscriptions while manual renew, cancellation and then re-subcription are not uncommon. \"Currently, the company uses survival analysis techniques to determine the residual membership life time for each subscriber.\" The KKBox company hopes to discover why users leave and act accordingly to keep the users. They set the goal of competition: predict if a user will churn after their subscription expires. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined that a user does not churn at the membership expiration month if they turn out having subscription from any point of the next 30 days from the expiration date. That is, the cases of re-subscribing later after 30 days should be seen as a negative case. \n",
    "\n",
    "KKBox asks to predict for users who has membership expiring at a specific month, April 2017. The prediction model should minimize Log Loss, where <i>N</i> is number of observations, <i>p_i</i> is the probablity that obervation <i>i</i> is positive, and <i>y_i</i> indicates if the obervation <i>i</i> is positive (1) or negative (0):"
